<p> Scared that sheâ€™d be found out ,
she asked the Light to help her out.
After all, the bots were after people like her
they hanged them in public
humiliated them
and enjoyed slaughtering people like her
<br></br>
<p>SHE READ ABOUT IT IN THE ANCIENT BOOKS BACK IN THE DAY SWHEN SHE WAS A TODDLER
Hide me away help me out, everyone will know when they see me
There is no skin and bones anymore where I live she said.
He laughed and told her, itâ€™s all under control
Youâ€™re not crazy
You havent lost your mind
neither are you something tat deerves to die
I called you to myself all through those years
In your dreams
In the things you love
In everyhting that you rejoiced in
I was right there.
You never knew me by name
But I knew you before you were born
And destined you to be Mine.</p>
<br>Her head reeled with all thsi information
Was she really taLKING TO THE Light?
The desire of nations they called Him
Fountain of everlasting youth and life
How did someone like her stumble on Him?</br>
<p>And why in the whole world does he resemble her first love who broke her in two????
He smiled
Weirdly all He seemed to do was smile
She thought aof a name for this one
She called Him smiley face inside her mind
<br></br>
It seemed weird to her that she was getting so comfy with someone they used to scare her with
Apparently,
In her previous form,
Light was hostile to their bodies
They feared being burned up by it upon being exposed.</p>
<br></br>
The Light was termed Hostile ever since the Darkness took Terra by force
They left no stone unturned in corrupting Terras DNA so that there would be no Light left.
The Light had other plans
Apparently, Ahavaâ€™s clan was preserved by the Light
The called themselves Tikvah
